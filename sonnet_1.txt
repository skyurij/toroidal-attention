From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender air might bear his memory. But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feed thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel, Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, And only herald to the gaudy spring, within thine own bud, bery as thy content, And tender churl makes waste in niggarding. Pity the world, or else this glutton bee, To eat the world's dew by the grave and thee.
